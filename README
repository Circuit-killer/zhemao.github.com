My github pages site. I am putting this repository up because I will be 
putting my Desktop computer into storage for the summer, and so my regular
website will be unavailable. 

This is essentially just a static mirror of the front
page of http://zhehaomao.com/. The index and myapps page are present, as well
as the javascript/html5 demos. The blog has been moved to 
http://zhemao.tumblr.com.
