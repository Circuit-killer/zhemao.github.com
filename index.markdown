I am a Computer Engineering major at Columbia University. 
My interests are in digital hardware design, FPGA prototyping, embedded
systems, Linux kernel hacking, systems programming, and parallel computing.

You can find some of my code on [Github](https://github.com/zhemao) 
and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/zhemao). I have some videos of my
hardware projects on [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/zhemaoce).
