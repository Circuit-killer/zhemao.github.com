EZ8 is an 8-bit processor architecture I designed to have a very
simple encoding. The goal was to make the hardware implementation very easy
and understandable. I implemented an EZ8 microcontroller in Verilog using a
3-stage interlocking pipeline. The microcontroller can run on an Arrow SoCKit
Cyclone V development board and interface with simple peripherals like leds,
keys, switches, and a millisecond-precision timer. I also implemented a
software emulator and an assembler for EZ8 assembly.
The Verilog descriptions, software source code, and documentation can be found
on [Github](https://github.com/zhemao/ez8).
