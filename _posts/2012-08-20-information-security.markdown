# Information Security in the Modern Age

## Steps you can take to make your electronic life more secure

Most of you have probably heard about such recent IT security boondoggles as
the server break-ins at LinkedIn, Last.fm, and other popular websites, as 
well as the truly disastrous hijacking of Wired reporter Mat Honan's iCloud,
Gmail, and Twitter accounts. These are just the most publicized incidents. 
Many more such events occur without showing up on the front page of Wired or
Gizmodo. Many of these breaches were the result of mistakes made by the 
companies trusted with safeguarding the data, and there's not much users
can do to change that. However, there are some steps that anyone can take to 
increase the security of their online accounts and mitigate the potential 
damage of such electronic attacks. In light of these recent events, I thought 
I would share some of the steps I take to make sure that my personal 
information and communications are secure.

Disclaimer: Though I am quite knowledgable about computers and technology, 
I am by no means a computer security expert, so take everything I say here with
a grain of salt. These are just some of the security habits I practice. I have
tried to order my suggestions here from simple and urgently necessary to complex
and probably unnecessarily paranoid. It's up to you to decide whether they are
worth following. If in doubt about the efficacy of some of these practices,
please consult an actual security expert, like 
[Bruce Schneier](http://www.schneier.com/). 

## 1. Use random passwords and a password manager

Probably one of the most horribly insecure but also most widely practiced 
security habits is password reuse. Most people either use the same password
on multiple sites, in which case all of those accounts will be compromised if
the password is cracked, or they use passwords that are easy to remember and
therefore easy for attackers to guess. This is only natural of course. One can
only remember so many unique passwords. Fortunately, there is a better way.
You can generate a unique, random password for each account using services such
as [random.org](http://random.org), and then store the password using a password
manager. A password manager is basically a database that stores all your 
credentials and which is itself encrypted with a single master password. If 
you are using recent versions of Chrome or Firefox, there is already a password
manager built in to your browser. These password managers can fill in your
username and password for you automatically when you go to a website's login
page and can sync your stored password across multiple computers.

## 2. Use Google Two-Factor Authentication

Most sites allow you to use your email address to reset your password if you
forget it. Therefore, it is important to make sure your email account is extra
secure. Fortunately for Gmail users, Google offers two-factor authentication
for your Google account. How two-factor authentication works is that you enter
your Google account password in as usual, and then Google sends a one-time
PIN to your phone. You will then be required to enter this PIN on the next
form in order to log in. You can also set the computers you own as trusted
computers, in which case Google will only ask for the secondary login once
every 30 days. If you link third party clients to your google account (such
as email or chat clients), you can set application-specific passwords for them.
