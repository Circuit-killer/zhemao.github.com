Palimpsest is a very simple HTML5 Canvas drawing application. It is written
in ClojureScript and can run in a web browser without any backing server.

The application optionally supports smoothing lines drawn by the user using
the Bezier curve-fitting algorithm described in "An Algorithm for Automatically
Fitting Digitized Curves" by Phillip Schneider.
