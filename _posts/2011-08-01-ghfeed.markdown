# My First Heroku App: Github Feed

Over the weekend I wrote a website to create RSS feeds from github repositories
using Github post-receive hooks. Basically, if you add the site as a 
post-receive url, it will look for any commits with a @rss in the commit
message and store the info in the database. You can then navigate to a url and 
get a generated RSS feed of all the flagged commits. The website is up at
[ghfeed.heroku.com](http://ghfeed.heroku.com). The application is open-source,
and the github repo can be found at 
[github.com/zhemao/gfheed](https://github.com/zhemao/ghfeed). Github feed is 
built on Sinatra and MongoDB.
