## Brief Bio

My name is Zhehao Mao, but everyone calls me Howie. I am a computer engineering 
major in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at Columbia University. 
I grew up in Charleston, SC, but reside in New York City during the school year. 
Computer programming and electronics are my main hobbies, as well as my calling 
in life. You can find some of my code on [Github](https://github.com/zhemao/") 
and [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/zhemao). I also have a 
[blog](http://zhemao.tumblr.com), which I update rather infrequently.
